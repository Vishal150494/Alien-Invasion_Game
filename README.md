# Alien Invasion_Game
 This is a python project which uses Pygame package to develop a 2D game. Goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. End goal is to learn this skill of developing my own 2D games in Pygame.
